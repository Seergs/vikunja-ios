# Viku

**Native iOS client for Vikunja with beautiful design and great user experience.**

</div>

**This is not an official Vikunja Client app**

This is an opinionated mobile client for Vikunja, not a full port of the web app. 
Vikunja already has an official PWA and a [capable third-party one](https://github.com/Bassey240/vikunja-pwa), 
and both aim to mirror the web experience feature for feature. This app takes a different position.

It is built to be what you reach for when you are away from your computer: a
fast, native view of what matters today, and a frictionless way to capture a
task before you forget it. Planning, reorganizing, and deep project work stay on
the web, where they belong.

## How to Use

### Installation

You can find this app in the App Store

### Setup

1. Create an API Token in Vikunja. See the [required scopes](#required-permissions)
2. Connect to your Vikunja Instance in the app using the token

## Features

### The app

- **Multiple Instances:** Connect several Vikunja accounts and switch between them.
- **Today:** An account-wide list of what is overdue, due today, and coming up across every project, behind quick filters.
- **Quick Capture:** Add a task in one tap from the tab bar, the Today home-screen widget, or the `viku://quick-add` deep link
- **Widgets:** Quickly see your daily tasks and a calendar view from your Home screen.

### Planned

- Offline Support
- Native Push Notifications

## Philosophy & Scope

### What it is for

- **Today at a glance.** An account-wide view of what is overdue, due today, and coming up, across every project.
- **Capturing tasks fast.** From the home-screen widget, a deep link, Siri, or a one-tap sheet, with the minimum fields needed and nothing else.
- **Checking in on projects.** A simple browsable tree with completion progress, plus enough task detail (due date, priority, labels, comments, attachments, relations) 
    to act on something without switching devices.
- **Staying out of the way.** Native, lightweight, quick to open and quick to close.

### What it is not

- Not a reimplementation of the full Vikunja web UI.
- No saved filters, no Gantt, no bulk editing.
- No team or permission administration, no instance configuration.
- Not a place for long planning sessions. It is tuned for glances and quick capture, not for restructuring your workload.
